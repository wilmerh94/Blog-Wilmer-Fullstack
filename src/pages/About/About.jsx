        <p>
          I am a web developer, usually working on web applications. My most recent work experience is as a
          freelance web developer creating responsive Web Applications, provided automatic secure API to
          interact with the web/mobile application, payment, data reporting and storage. I am responsible for
          writing the overarching cloud web App with GCP to the cloud, running scheduled tasks, The firmware
          allowed it to automatically handle setting up new users and save the information on a GCP.

            <p>I am a expert in front end development and have a strong working knowledge of the back-end</p>
            <p>Web Front-End: Base: React, Data Management: Redux, Layout: MaterialUI</p>
            <p>
              I typically develop front-ends as a single page app using a React base. I am a huge fan of the
              Redux pattern of unidirectional data flow. It introduces its own headaches and overhead, but I
              find it solves more problems than it creates. For layouts and components, I have found that
              Material-UI is one of the best libraries out there as far as supported components, customable,
              and end performance. I find Material-UI usually offers a great starting point that gets a
              project quickly kicked off.

            <h2>Web Backend</h2>
            <p>Base: NodeJS, GCP. Data Management: FireStore, NoSQL</p>
            <p>
              Most recently I have been using GCP with NoSQL as a backend for single page apps that I write. A
              lot of GCP power comes from utilities for working with forms, views, and templates. I have
              lately found Firebase and Firestore to be a great replacement that allows rapid development.
